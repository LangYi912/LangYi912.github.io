            <p>Hwasa is the main vocalist and lead rapper in Mamamoo, she was born in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea on July 25, 1995, with the birth name Ahn Hye Jin and graduated from Wonkwang Information Arts High School. Hwasa has two elder sisters which mean she’s the youngest in her family. Hwasa was considered Mamamoo's cook because she loves cooking. Hwasa’s appearance was being attacked by many anti-fans saying her appearance doesn’t fit Kpop, but Hwasa didn’t get affected by those hate comments instead she released two solo songs Twit and Maria (they were being released at different times). Where both of them are really good and she got awarded too. Hwasa is allergic to animal fur so she doesn’t have a pet, but when Mamamoo talks about pets she usually refers to the lion toy she had.</p>
